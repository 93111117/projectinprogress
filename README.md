# Monopoly Phase I
This was a project we had to do for Advanced Programming course. It was implementing a monopoly game with chat and network capability.
It is in no way perfect and I was a real [super] novice back then, expect bugs and bad code style. Naturally we just wanted to get
the job done :D and we succeded.
